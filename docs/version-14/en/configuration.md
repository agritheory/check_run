# Configuration

## Banks and Bank Accounts

The Check Run feature requires at least one `Bank` and `Bank Account` defined for the Company. These can be set up under `Accounting > Bank` and `Accounting > Bank Account`, respectively.

For parties receiving payment via an electronic bank transfer, their `Bank` and `Bank Account` must be in the system as well. See the sections below for configuration details for Suppliers and Employees.

## Mode of Payment

The Check Run application adds a new `type` field into the `Mode of Payment` doctype. The field helps the application properly process different types of payment methods.

For any existing or new `Mode of Payment` document, you can specify one of the following `type` options in the table below. The "Bank" and "Electronic" options are special, and will change the behavior of a Check Run. Usage suggestions are included with each option.

| Type | Suggested Usage |
|---|---|
| Bank | Payments requiring a physical check |
| Cash | Cash payments |
| Electronic | ACH electronic fund transfers, direct deposit |
| General | Bank drafts, wire transfers, credit cards |
| Phone | Phone payments |

Only Modes of Payment marked as "Electronic" will be included in ACH file generation. This should be reserved for methods like "ACH/EFT" or "Employee Direct Deposit". ACH files are intended to represent electronic inter-bank transactions.

## Default Mode of Payment

The options that show in the dropdown for Mode of Payment in a Check Run are determined by the `Mode of Payment` documents defined in an ERPNext site. The Check Run application includes new fields in the `Supplier` and `Employee` doctypes to specify a default `Mode of Payment`. If populated, this option will automatically show in a Check Run for any payables owed to that party.

## Supplier Configuration

The `Supplier` doctype has three new fields under the "Credit Limit" section to specify the `Default Supplier Mode of Payment`, `Bank`, and `Bank Account`. As noted above, if there is a value for the `Supplier Default Mode of Payment`, it will automatically show in the Check Run for any invoices for that supplier.

The `Bank` and `Bank Account` fields are retrieved by the system to facilitate payments when the mode of payment is an electronic type.

## Employee Configuration

Similarly, the `Employee` doctype includes new `Mode of Payment`, `Bank`, and `Bank Account` fields in the "Salary Details" section. The `Mode of Payment` value will show in a Check Run, and the system uses the `Bank` and `Bank Account` values for electronic payments.
