# Example Print Format: Voucher Check

To take advantage of Check Run's check printing functionality, you'll need to set up a print format in ERPNext. Print formats are as unique as the organizations using ERPNext, so a voucher check print format (coming soon) serves as an example template. It can be a starting point from which to customize to suit your needs.
