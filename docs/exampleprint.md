# Example Print Format: Voucher Check

[TODO: add print format to Check Run]

To take advantage of Check Run's check printing functionality, you'll need to set up a print format in ERPNext. Print formats are as unique as the organizations using ERPNext, so this voucher check print format serves as an example template. It can be a starting point from which to customize to suit your needs.
