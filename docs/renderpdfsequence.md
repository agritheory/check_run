# Render PDF Sequence

After a Check Run has been submitted, it will begin rendering the Checks it needs to print. Even on powerful systems it can take several minutes to render checks. The Check Run creates a new Folder in the File Manager for PDFs. These will be linked to the Check Run but removed when the user confirms they have printed correctly.
